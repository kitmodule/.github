👋 Hello World. Welcome to **KitModule**

Build ideas into modules and develop kits into Open Source.  
**KitModule** is the creative space of a dreamy indie-stack developer, where each module is a seed and each kit is the result of experimentation and new thinking — a journey to share the dream with the open-source community.

🪶 **Lightweight** — built with pure HTML, CSS, JS, and Golang, requiring no setup  
🔁 **Modular** — every part can work independently or together in harmony  
💡 **Declarative** — logic and behavior are defined naturally through attributes  
⚡ **Fast to Learn** — everything you need lives inside a single file  
❤️ **Open Source** — created by developers for developers  

**Philosophy:** Small modules, big dreams 🌱  
**Mindset:** Build in Public, embrace Open Source, keep it simple, stay practical, and keep learning continuously.  
**Dreamer**: [Huỳnh Nhân Quốc](https://github.com/huynhnhanquoc)
