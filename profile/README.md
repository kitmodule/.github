👋 Hello World  _< Welcome to [**KitModule**](https://kitmodule.com) />_

Build ideas into modules and develop kits into Open Source.  
**KitModule** is the creative space of a dreamy indie-stack developer, where each module is a seed and each kit is the result of experimentation and new thinking — a journey to share the dream with the open-source community.

✨ Core Principles

**Lightweight**: Built with pure HTML, CSS, JS, and Golang, requiring no setup  
**Modular**: Every part can work independently or together in harmony  
**Declarative**: Logic and behavior are defined naturally through attributes  
**Fast to Learn**: Everything you need lives inside a single file  
**Open Source**: Created by developers for developers  

🌱 Philosophy & Mindset

**Philosophy:** Small modules, big dreams  
**Mindset:** Build in Public · Embrace Open Source · Keep it simple · Stay practical · Learn continuously
